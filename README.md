# Java Tutorium

This repository contains the code examples, that are created during the tutorial lessons.
It is meant to be used as reference, hen you want to write the explained example by your self or expand it.

## Project Structure:

All code is in the `src` folder. For every example/tutorial there is a folder. Every tutorial folder contains a 
README.md file with a short summary of the lesson and a `src` folder with the code.


## Using the repository

If you have any problems setting up this project or any other questions, 
you are welcome to ask them in the tutorial lessons.
